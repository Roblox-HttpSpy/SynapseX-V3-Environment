# SynapseX-V3-Environment
Bunch of scripts i made that replicates bunch of [SynapseX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse_X) unreleased V3 functions/Methods in pure [LuaU](https://luau.org/)

Synapse made Documentation for there V3 (that never got fully released dou to Synapse shutting down)

you can find a saved SynapseX V3 documentation here: https://actualmasteroogway.github.io/synapse-x-documentation/

they had some unique ideas so i decided to script LuaU script that mimics some of there Custom Classes/Functions & methods and so on,

hope you enjoy!

<small> *(NOTE) this is a imitation of said classes, some of these may not exactly work what is expected, also if you encounter any errors make sure it isnt from your scripting mistake before opening a issue.. also if your a executor developer not recommended to implement this, Atleast recreate it with purely in C* </small>
